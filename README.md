We're currently working on developing a repo of media. 

### What we need in flat, .svg formats: 

- [ ] Tor logo
- [ ] Tor onion 
- [ ] Onion favicon
- [ ] Tor browser logo
- [ ] Med-priority images
- [ ] Tor metrics logo 
- [ ] Download now button
- [ ] Donate to Tor button
- [ ] ppt presentation templates 
- [ ] "I support Tor" banner to put on websites and blogs
- [ ] "Uses Tor inside" banner for associated projects

### Notes: 

* we'll use the onion as the tor browser logo instead of the weird globe icon; it's confusing to have different icons for Tor applications. 
* we want to make the orfox icon and the tor onion icon be the same icon at one point, for brand unity.
